				<p>In this theme we learnt about the design and development of digital experiences with a
					focus on understanding the user, the userâ€™s interaction with solutions as well as on
					evaluating and testing solutions.</p>
				<p>We
					work with video and how to develop it in iterative steps using treatment and
					storyboard to professionalise the production.</p>

				<p>The goal of this project was to create a XD prototype for website about cycling in Copenhagen. The target group were tourists, so we placed some information about renting the bikes in Chp and introduced "the route of the month".
					<p>I was a designer in this group and helped to create a design of the page and all the documents.
						<p>For color scheme of moodboard we have choosen soft pastel colors and from design principles we used mostly law of symmetry,proximity and a lot of white space.</p>
						<p>For the final website we used only mint green color which was not the best idea and we received mixed feedback from teacher's about it, they reccomended us to use more colors from our color scheme.</p><br>

				<p>The last part of this project was making a short video, story in Premier which should be able to communicate with our target group and match the idea of the website.We draw a storyboard, we created a story about 3 people-tourists who will randomly meet in the bike renting shop and thank to bikes become good friends. </p>
				<p>
					After, we wrote a Treatment document where we describted the theme of the story, the protagonists and antagonists.
					I was playing in the video and also helping out to cut and choose the final clips. We spend one day filming outside and had a lot of footage. Unfortunately we could not use most of the clips which we made, the videos were shaky and bad quality. We made a final video but we were not so proud of it.</p><br>

				<p>We have to come up with an interesting story which must be told without any spoken words. The video must be filmed on smarthphones and the clips cut in Premier pro program.</p>
				<p> We created a story about a girl, who wakes up and has an amazing day -breakfast in the bed, free coffee in her favourite coffee shop, finding money on the street but in the end everything is just a dream.</p>
				<p> We made a lot of shots,filmed in different part of Copenhagen. We included a lot of close up and long shots and were very happy about the result. We also received a positive feedback from teacher and the classmates.
