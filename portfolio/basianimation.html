				<p>In this project we have been introduced to Javascript, CSS animation or transition.</p><p>The main goal of this project was creating a website containing a character and buttons.</p><p> When the user clicks a button, an animation starts.i created different animations such as jump, rotate or walk by using CSS keyframes animation.</p>
				<p>From Javascript we used function,querySelector and addEventlistener.It was a bit difficult for me in the beginning but with teachers and classmates help i was able to finish this project.</p><br>

				<p>This project included creating a story with clear message and describing the genre/mood of the story. The story had to have a dramaturgic
					curve which consists of a prelude, point of no return, climax and end - fade out. </p><p>The storyboard had to include all the dramaturgical elements (e.g sounds,time, movement) and we had to create a narrative curve too.
				I created a story called " The relationship goals".</p><p> It was about couple Linda and Tom who are getting ready to go out, but Linda keeps complaing that she has nothing to wear.When she finally found an outfit, Tom meanwhile turned into skeleton.</p>

				<p> This interactive story has to consist of at least 3 chained events that bring the story forward and we had to use at least 3 different event types (click, ended, animationend) and the scene should included the sound too. For animating our characters we used CSS keyframes animation. From Javascript we used document.getElementByID,console.log or addEventListener.</p>
						<p>We made our project in group of three and it was quite difficult for us. We needed some classmates help but after we were able to make it and finish it. There is a lot to improve on this project but i was able to learn how to make an interactive animation using javascript.The story included sequence diagram and storyboard as well.</p><br>

				<p>This was definately the most difficult project for me , we needed a lot of teachers help while coding it.In the first project we have to Make a "Smack the fly game" where the user must hit an annoying spinning fly to stop it from buzzing around. The fly should stay within the browser window and move randomly all over it while buzzing annoyingly until clicked. </p>
				<p>In the second project we made a simple calculator that adds two numbers. Add two input fields and a button labeled "Add numbers" and return the sum of the numbers typed into the form.</p><br>

				<p>This was a group project,we were a group of 7. We received the style,music and we have to create the characters in illustrator and animate it using CSS and Javascript. Our style was surrealism and we decided to make a story about Pinocchio.</p><p> My role was designer and UX. I designed the last "trippy" scene and done the user testing, which included peer review. </p>
				<p> We received very good feedback from teachers about this project and were very glad about it.</p><br>
