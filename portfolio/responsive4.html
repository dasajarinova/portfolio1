				<p class="leading-text">In this theme i have learnt how to structure content using basic semantic markup (HTML 5) and presenting content using CSS3 in order to create a simple website, how to use FTP to upload on the website and how to validate my codes. </p>
				<p>I also gained knowledge how to use Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe InDesign and Adobe XD.</p>

				<p>The main goal of this project was creating a responsive website (website which is responsive to different screen sizes of devices) using a grid system (layout system with rows and columns ). Everyone had to create their own website based on their XD prototype and the design of the site should be based on the given style -Mine style was deconstruction.</p>
				<p> The most difficult part for me was coding and creating the grid, i spent a lot of time watching youtube tutorials and looking for some online examples. Apart from grid layout we also learnt about media query and we had to implement at least two break points with media query in CSS file. </p>
				<p>During creating a website I tried to use some design principles such as law of proximity,similarity connection or contrast. For logo design i used Gestald principle-similarity. This was my first responsive website ever so i am not fully satisfied with it, but i learnt a lot. </p><br>
